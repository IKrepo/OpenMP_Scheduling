Make use of OpenMP directives to parallelise loop1 and loop2 of loops.c file.

Once the code is parallelised, run the code on 4 threads on a personal workstation or a supercomputer.
Use the following SCHEDULE clause options:
• STATIC
• AUTO
• STATIC,n
• DYNAMIC,n
• GUIDED,n

For the last three cases, n (the chunksize) takes the values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.
From these experiments, determine for each loop the best scheduling option on 4 threads. Using this
option (which may be different for the two loops), run the code on 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 threads.
